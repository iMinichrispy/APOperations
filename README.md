## APOperations

APOperations is an Objective-C implementation of the [WWDC 2015 Advanced NSOperations](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-226/) sample code, wrapped in a framework. Also incorporates changes made to the sample code in [PSOperations](https://github.com/pluralsight/PSOperations).

###### Why?

As a way of learning a bit more Swift and familiarizing myself with the the `NSOperation` APIs.
