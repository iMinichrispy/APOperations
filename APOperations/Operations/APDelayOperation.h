/*!
 * @class APDelayOperation
 * @abstract A subclass of `APOperation` that will wait for a given time interval or until a specific `NSDate`
 * @note It is important to note that this operation does **not** use the `sleep()` function, since that is inefficient and blocks the thread on which it is called. Instead, this operation uses `dispatch_after` to know when the appropriate time has passed.
 * @discussion If the time interval is negative, or the `NSDate` is in the past, then this operation immediately finishes
